							<P>Tonight everyone's at the hottest party in town, and nobody wants to be there. Unsteady Seti Marimbe is doing his best to hide from the problems he's made for himself. Kind-hearted Kit Kitterson is lost in a sea of cool punks who aren't interersted in anything he has to say. Simmering Sage Koski is having a philosophical breakdown that can only end in violence. Ill-mannered Isaiah Kitterson has decided not to bother showing up at all.</p>
