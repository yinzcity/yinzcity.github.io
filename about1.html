							<p><b>Q: who the hell is writing <i>YINZ CITY</i>?</b>
							<br>A: my name is higu rose. i'm an illustrator living in western PA.
my favorite movies are <i>Beverly Hills Cop, John Carpenter's The Thing, Tremors, Twice Upon a Time, </i>and <i>Blow Up</i>.
i have 14 tattoos.
							<p><b>Q: where/when does <i>YINZ CITY</i> take place?</b>
							<br>A: that is a secret.
							
							<p><b>Q: why does everyone use a flip phone?</b>
							<br>A: the story takes place in an althernate universe in which smart phones were never invented, because i hate them.
							<br>think of it like the galapagos effect in regard to Japanese cellphones, but if phones developed that way worldwide (although a few characters do use dated flip phones similar to older Western ones).

							<p><b>Q: how old is everyone in <i>YINZ CITY</i>?</b>
							<br>A: a very informal list of ages starting at Issue 1--
								<ul>
									<li>Seti - 23</li>
									<li>Kit - 19</li>
									<li>Sage - unclear; somewhere in their 20s</li>
									<li>Isaiah - 25</li>
									<li>Nabokov - 19</li>
									<li>Fiona - 24</li>
									<li>Miller - 25</li>
									<li>Shelley - ?????????</li>
								</ul>
								
							<p><b>Q: why does Seti suck so much?</b>
							<br>A: that's the question we're all asking ourselves.

							<p><b>Q: is Fiona supposed to have extra fingers?</b>
							<br>A: yes.

							<p><b>Q: is Fiona single?</b>
							<br>A: so she says.
							
							<p><b>Q: what are the scars on Sage's hands?</b>
							<br>A: they are burn scars.
							
							<p><b>Q: why do they go by Sage instead of Susquehanna?</b>
							<br>A: because no one outside of the Susquehanna Valley knows how to pronounce it.

							<p><b>Q: how DO you pronounce Susquehanna?</b>
							<br>A: suhs-kwuh-han-uh.
							<br>the name comes from the Lenape word "Sisa'we'hak'hanna", which roughly translates to "Oyster River".
							
							<p><b>Q: Didn't Isaiah's name used to be Misha? Are they the same character?</b>
							<br>A: yes and yes. i think Isaiah is a cuter name. Misha is his dead name, both canonically and on a meta level.
							
							<p><b>Q: why does Shelley look like Damon Albarn? IS he actually Damon Albarn?</b>
							<br>A: i don't know what you're talking about...

							<p><b>Q: how often do issues come out?</b>
							<br>A: i dont know... i just don't know...
							
							<p><b>Q: whens the Scottish Randy chapter?</b>
							<br>A: when i'm on my deathbed.
