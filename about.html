							<p><b>Q: who the hell is writing <i>YINZ CITY</i>?</b>
							<br>A: my name is higu rose. i'm an illustrator living in western PA.
my favorite movies are <i>Beverly Hills Cop, John Carpenter's The Thing, Tremors, Twice Upon a Time, </i>and <i>Blow Up</i>. i have 18 tattoos.<br>
more of my work can be found at <a id="text" target="_blank" href="http://higu.cool/">HIGU.COOL</a>
							<p><b>Q: where/when does <i>YINZ CITY</i> take place?</b>
							<br>A: the location is a secret, but issue 1 happens around 2015-ish. the series takes place over 5 years.
							
							<p><b>Q: why does everyone use a flip phone?</b>
							<br>A: the story takes place in an alternate universe in which smart phones were never invented, because i think they're ugly.
							<br>think of it like the galapagos effect in regard to Japanese cellphones developing advanced features (social media access, texting services, customization, etc), but if phones developed that way worldwide (although a few characters do use dated flip phones similar to older Western ones).

							<p><b>Q: how old is everyone in <i>YINZ CITY</i>?</b>
							<br>A: from the beginning of the series:
								<ul>
									<li>Seti - 23</li>
									<li>Kit - 19</li>
									<li>Sage - unclear; somewhere in their 20s</li>
									<li>Isaiah - 25</li>
									<li>Nabokov - 19</li>
									<li>Fiona - 24</li>
									<li>Miller - 25</li>
									<li>Shelley - ?????????</li>
								</ul>
								
							<p><b>Q: why does Seti suck so much?</b>
							<br>A: that's the question we're all asking ourselves.

							<p><b>Q: is Fiona supposed to have extra fingers?</b>
							<br>A: yes.

							<p><b>Q: is Fiona single?</b>
							<br>A: no, but she and Miller are fairly open.
							
							<p><b>Q: what are the scars on Sage's hands?</b>
							<br>A: they are burn scars.
							
							<p><b>Q: why do they go by Sage instead of Susquehanna?</b>
							<br>A: because no one outside of the Susquehanna Valley knows how to pronounce it.

							<p><b>Q: how DO you pronounce Susquehanna?</b>
							<br>A: suhs-kwuh-han-uh.
							<br>the name comes from the Lenape word "Sisa'we'hak'hanna", which roughly translates to "Oyster River".
							
							<p><b>Q: Didn't Isaiah's name used to be Misha? Are they the same character?</b>
							<br>A: yes and yes. i think Isaiah is a cuter name. Misha is his dead name, both canonically and on a meta level.
							
							<p><b>Q: why does Shelley look like Damon Albarn? IS he actually Damon Albarn?</b>
							<br>A: i don't know what you're talking about...

							<p><b>Q: how often do issues come out?</b>
							<br>A: once every several months... ish... maybe... you can follow my <a id="text" target="_blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/higoons">twitter</a> or my <a id="text" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/higoons">instagram</a> for progress updates. you can subscribe to <a id="text" target="_blank" href="https://tinyletter.com/higu">my newsletter</a> to be notified of issue drops and general art news!
							
							<p><b>Q: whens the Scottish Randy chapter?</b>
							<br>A: when i'm on my deathbed.
